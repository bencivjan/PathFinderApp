# [Node Pathfinder Web App](http://bencivjan.me/PathFinderApp)

This application uses the [A* pathfinding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) to find the path between two nodes in a graph.

The user can:
- Move the start and end nodes by clicking and dragging
- Add walls by clicking and dragging on the graph
- Delete walls by clicking and holding `shift`
- Visualize the algorithm by toggling the `visualize algorithm` switch

I built this application entirely from vanilla js and the canvas browser API.
